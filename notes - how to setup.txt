I set up my project with GitHub.
=>Create a New Repository on GitHub
=>Clone the Repository Using GitHub Desktop
        stored the project on my local machine under C:\Users\...\Github\project_name

=>Navigate to the directory where the repository was clone
        cd path_name
=>Create a Virtual Environment named venv
        python -m venv venv
=>Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
    🎀-----------------------🎀
        venv\Scripts\activate
    🎀-----------------------🎀
        see the (venv) in cmd

=>Install Dependencies

1) manually
        pip install jupyterlab
        pip install pandas
        pip install scikit-learn
        pip install Matplotlib
        pip install seaborn


2) Use the requirements.txt file 
        
        To install all the necessary packages:
        ----
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ----
        This command installs all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file with the specified versions.

=>Make Initial Commit:
    back to GitHub Desktop, check the changes made (e.g., the virtual environment folder, requirements.txt, etc.).
    Add a commit message like "Initial commit with project setup".
    🐦Click Commit to main.
=>Push the Changes to GitHub:
    After committing changes, 🐦click on "Push origin" in the top toolbar of GitHub Desktop to upload changes to GitHub.


!!! Generally not advisable to share the env folder
=>In project directory, create a file named .gitignore.
        🦄On windows, can stay in virtual environment and type
        echo. > .gitignore
=>Open the .gitignore file in any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code) and add the paths or patterns you want to ignore.
        In this case, just add 
        venv/
        inside the file (or whatever_vertual_envirment_name/ )
        save the file, commit to git, push to origin




🦄to deactivate the virtual environment, just type in
        ----
        deactivate
        or
        venv\Scripts\deactivate
        ----

Because Jupyter Lab is installed in the venv, first be in the venv - should be a (venv) in start of line in cmd

=> Open the Jupyter Lab environment.
