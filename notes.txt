Downloaded python from their website, installed it.
    used the standard installation “Install Now” and checked the boxes for “Add Python to PATH…”, and “Install as administrator…”

Went to cmd:
    pip install virtualenv

Decided to set up my project with GitHub.
=>Created a New Repository on GitHub
=>Clone the Repository Using GitHub Desktop
        stored the project on my local machine under C:\Users\...\class name

=>Navigated to the directory where my repository was clone
        cd path_name
=>Create a Virtual Environment named venv
        python -m venv venv
=>Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
        venv\Scripts\activate
        see the (venv) in cmd

=>Install Dependencies
        pip install jupyterlab
=>Save the installed packages to a requirements.txt file
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        🐦It's a good practice for future reference! 
        Also easy: After installing the packages, generate the requirements.txt file by running "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
        🦄How to use this file in the future to set up the same environment (by chatGPT)
        1. Clone the Project:
        Clone the repository from GitHub (as you did earlier).
        2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
        Create and activate a virtual environment in the project directory.
        3.Install the Dependencies:
        Use the requirements.txt file to install all the necessary packages:
        ----
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ----
        This command installs all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file with the specified versions.
